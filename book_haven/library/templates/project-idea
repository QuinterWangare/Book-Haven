The Library Management System is a beginner-friendly web application designed to manage books in a simple library setup.
It allows users to perform basic operations such as adding, editing, viewing, and deleting book records.
Users can also search for books by title or author and mark books as "borrowed" or "available." The system includes a user authentication feature, enabling users to sign up, log in, and log out securely.
Built using Django, this project combines essential CRUD functionality with a clean and intuitive interface, making it an excellent introduction to web development and database management.
